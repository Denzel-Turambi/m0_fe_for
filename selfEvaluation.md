# Self Evaluation

- **How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `for` statement?**
I feel kind of confident (6/10) in my understanding and fluency for `for` statements. 
- **This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?**
It actually felt really good to apply the previous lessons into this lesson, because it made me realize the amount of progress I've made so far. I had a very productive struggle during this assignment. 
- **What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?**
I need to practice the for statement practice problems in the assignment details/notes, because I was having a hard time figuring out how to do some of those. I will definitely go back and revisit them. 
- **What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?**
Is it possible to make the `for` statement have numbers that go into negative (<0)? I will Google.
